<h3>
	Prologue
</h3>
	
<p> 
	Two households, both alice in dignity,<br>
	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
	From forth the fatal loins of these two foxes<br>
	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
	Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
	And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
	The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
